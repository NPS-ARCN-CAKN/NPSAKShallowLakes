## Shallow Lakes Monitoring Program. National Park Service, Alaska Region

An R package to connect scientists to data.  

SQL databases are the premier option for data storage and retrieval of long-term ecosystem monitoring data. R is a popular statistical package for analyzing such data. Getting data from a database into R is often a time-consuming step requiring specialized technical knowledge - time that could be  better spent analyzing data.  

This package works like a data faucet for the Shallow Lakes monitoring program. You just open the tap for the data stream of interest. There is no requirement to know how the pipes work.
